/**
 * Creates a new function that runs each of the functions supplied as parameters in turn,
 * passing the return value of each function invocation to the next function invocation,
 * beginning with whatever arguments were passed to the initial invocation.
 *
 * `pipe` is the mirror version of `compose`. `pipe` is left-associative, which means that
 * each of the functions provided is executed in order from left to right.

 * @return {Function} A new function which represents the result of calling each of the
